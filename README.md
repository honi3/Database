NOTE/ This is a very beginner-level program that we only used MySQL, and many features are missing, for example, we could have added another table for colors for the colors used in a project because color is essential for interior companies, that is why we could do that, even though the color character limit is 100, so the employee can insert more than one color like ("black" "red" "blue") but this can easily lead to misspelling. but we wanted to keep it simple for now.
